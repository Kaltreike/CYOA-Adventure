# CYOA-Adventure
My starter C++ text-based project

Simple Choose Your Own Adventure Starter Project: Jim Aspinall

****

This is the traditional text-based adventure game and code I created using C++ in Visual Studio 2017.
It was created using traditional initialization, input, output, and array functions to permit a branching exclusive storyline reminiscent of the traditional CYOA format.
This took many tries to establish a working array with no errors.
My next priority from here will be to use code to establish inclusive paths that do not exclude each other, as well as push.back inventories and attributes for more depth.

If you have any insights to offer, or corrections to make, please feel free.
